a twitter bot that can understand the sentiment a randomly generated sentence has and pair it with an appropriate feeling and emoji

<h3>how the bot works:</h3>

1. each tweet randomly creates a sentence (one that hopefully makes sense)

2. it then analyzes the sentence to detect it's 'sentiment' and it gives it a score

3. depending on the score, the sentence is paired with a word and emoji that accurately explains the feelings expressed in the sentence!
